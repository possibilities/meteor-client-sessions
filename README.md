# Client Sessions for Meteor

A smart package for tracking clients across requests

[Check out the demo!](http://client-sessions.meteor.com/)

## Usage

I'll add instructions eventually. Until then check out demo app in repo.

## Running the demo

1. Make sure you have Meteor installed
2. From bash, launch **./install-dependencies.sh** and follow instructions
3. cd to the demo folder, run **meteor**

## TODO

Add an endpoint that can delete expired sessions, find nice way to schedule
